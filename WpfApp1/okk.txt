User Story: Common Operation Configuration Control

Title: Create a Reusable Configuration Control for All Filter Operations

As a Programmer,
I want to create a common WPF user control that can be included within the configuration view for any selected filter operation,
so that I can provide a consistent way for users to set a standard Override and Value parameter across different operations, reducing code duplication and standardizing the UI.
Acceptance Criteria:

    Given the common configuration control is displayed,
    When it is first rendered,
    Then it must contain a toggle button (e.g., ToggleButton or CheckBox) labeled "Override" and a numeric input field (e.g., TextBox) for an integer value.

    Given the "Override" toggle button is in its "off" (unchecked) state,
    When the user views the control,
    Then the numeric input field must be disabled and visually indicate that it is not editable (e.g., grayed out).

    Given the "Override" toggle button is in its "off" (unchecked) state,
    When the user clicks it,
    Then the toggle button must switch to its "on" (checked) state, and the numeric input field must become enabled and editable.

    Given the numeric input field is enabled,
    When the user enters a non-numeric character,
    Then the input must be rejected, and only integer values (0-9) should be permitted.

    Given the control is part of a larger view,
    When the user interacts with the toggle and the numeric input,
    Then the control's state must be correctly data-bound to two properties: a boolean for the toggle (Override) and an Int32 for the numeric field (Value).

    Given the control is instantiated,
    When default values are provided via data binding,
    Then the control must accurately reflect these initial Override (boolean) and Value (Int32) states.

    Given the user toggles the "Override" button (either on or off),
    When the state changes,
    Then the application must immediately send an OverrideValueRequest to the configured endpoint, containing both the new Override boolean and the current Value integer.

    Given an OverrideValueRequest has been sent,
    When the application receives a successful OverrideValueResponse (where Success is true),
    Then the UI state remains as set by the user, confirming the change.

    Given an OverrideValueRequest has been sent,
    When the application receives a failed OverrideValueResponse (where Success is false),
    Then the "Override" toggle must revert to its previous state, and the Error message from the response must be displayed to the user.

Notes for Implementation (WPF Specific):

    The control should be implemented as a UserControl to ensure reusability.

    Use XAML data binding with a TwoWay mode to link the UI elements to the underlying view model properties (bool Override, Int32 Value).

    The view model responsible for this control must handle the asynchronous logic for sending the OverrideValueRequest and processing the OverrideValueResponse. Consider using async/await patterns.

    Implement input validation on the TextBox to restrict input to integers only. This can be done via a behavior, an attached property, or by handling the PreviewTextInput event.

    Use a Style with a DataTrigger bound to the IsChecked property of the toggle button to automatically enable/disable the numeric TextBox.

    The control's DataContext should be set to a view model or object that exposes the Override and Value properties.

    A user feedback mechanism should be considered to indicate that a background operation is in progress (e.g., a temporary loading spinner) and to display any error messages from the API response.








    *************************************
    User Story: Validate Override Value via Endpoint

Title: Validate Filter Operation Override via Backend Service

As a System,
I want to send an OverrideValueRequest to a backend endpoint whenever the user modifies the override setting,
so that the change can be validated and persisted, and any business rule violations are communicated back to the user.
Acceptance Criteria:

    Given the user changes the Override toggle state in the UI,
    When the corresponding view model property is updated,
    Then an OverrideValueRequest must be constructed and sent to the configured endpoint.

    Given the request is being constructed,
    When it is prepared for sending,
    Then it must contain the Override boolean and the current Value integer from the view model.

    Given the endpoint returns a successful OverrideValueResponse (where Success is true),
    When the response is processed,
    Then the system acknowledges the change as valid, and no UI state reversal is needed.

    Given the endpoint returns a failed OverrideValueResponse (where Success is false),
    When the response is processed,
    Then the system must trigger a mechanism to inform the UI to revert the Override toggle to its previous state.

    Given a failed OverrideValueResponse is received,
    When it is processed,
    Then the Error message string from the response must be captured and made available to be displayed to the user.

    Given a network error or service timeout occurs while sending the request,
    When the error is caught,
    Then the system should treat it as a failed validation, revert the UI state, and present a generic error message (e.g., "Failed to connect to the service.").

Notes for Implementation (WPF Specific):

    This logic should be encapsulated within the view model that serves as the DataContext for the common user control, not in the UserControl's code-behind.

    Use an async/await pattern to call the endpoint without blocking the UI thread.

    The view model should maintain the "previous state" of the Override toggle so it can be reverted upon failure. This is critical for fulfilling acceptance criterion #4.

    Implement a mechanism (e.g., a property on the view model, a messaging system) for communicating the Error string back to the view for display in a TextBlock or a popup notification.


    3*************************************************
    User Story: Display Override Value Warning

Title: Notify User of Suboptimal Override Value During Operation

As a User,
I want to be notified during an operation if the override value I've set is considered suboptimal by the server,
so that I can make an informed decision about whether to let the operation continue or to stop it and adjust my settings for better results.
Acceptance Criteria:

    Given the client application is handling OperationProgressEvents from the server,
    When an OperationProgressEvent is received that contains the field OverrideValueWarning set to true,
    Then a clear, non-blocking warning message must be displayed to the user.

    Given the warning is to be displayed,
    When the message is shown,
    Then its text must clearly state that the server has identified a better value (e.g., "Warning: The server suggests a more optimal value is available than the one provided.").

    Given an OperationProgressEvent is received,
    When the OverrideValueWarning field is false or not present in the event payload,
    Then no new warning message regarding the override value should be shown.

    Given the warning message is displayed,
    When the user sees it,
    Then the message must not interrupt or block the ongoing operation or prevent the user from interacting with other parts of the application.

Notes for Implementation (WPF Specific):

    The logic to inspect the OperationProgressEvent should be located in the application's event handling or service layer.

    The warning message should be displayed using a non-modal UI element like a toast notification, a temporary banner at the top/bottom of the relevant view, or a message in a status bar. Avoid using a MessageBox which would block the UI.

    Consider implementing a dedicated notification service that can be called from the event handling logic to display messages to the user. This decouples the event processing from the UI implementation.

User Story: Relocate Common Configuration Control

Title: Refactor Common Configuration Control into New Parent Container

As a Programmer,
I want to move the existing common configuration UserControl from its current location into a new parent control,
so that the UI architecture is cleaner and aligns with updated design requirements, ensuring the control can be used effectively in its new context.
Acceptance Criteria:

    Given the refactoring task is complete,
    When the application is run,
    Then the common configuration control (with the "Override" toggle and numeric field) must no longer be present in its original parent control.

    Given the refactoring task is complete,
    When the user navigates to the view containing the new parent control,
    Then the common configuration control must be correctly rendered inside its new parent.

    Given the control is rendered in its new location,
    When the user interacts with it,
    Then all existing functionality must remain intact and fully operational, including:

        Toggling "Override" enables/disables the numeric field.

        Data binding to the Override and Value properties works correctly.

        The OverrideValueRequest is sent to the endpoint upon toggling.

        Responses from the endpoint are handled correctly (reverting state on failure).

    Given the control is in its new parent,
    When the UI is rendered,
    Then the layout, alignment, and spacing of the control must be visually correct and consistent with the design of the new parent container.

    Given the control has been moved,
    When the code is reviewed,
    Then the DataContext for the UserControl must be correctly inherited or set within its new position in the visual tree.

Notes for Implementation (WPF Specific):

    This is primarily a refactoring task. The focus is on moving existing XAML and ensuring bindings are re-established correctly.

    Pay close attention to the DataContext. The new parent control might have a different DataContext than the original, which could require adjustments to the binding paths.

    Thorough regression testing is critical to ensure that no functionality was broken during the move. All acceptance criteria from the original user stories for this control must still pass.

    Visual styles (implicit or explicit) might need to be adjusted if the new parent container affects them differently (e.g., through resource dictionaries or inherited properties).

User Story: Adapt to API Contract Change for Override Validation

Title: Update Client to Align with New Override Validation API Contract

As a System,
I want to update the data models and logic for the override validation endpoint,
so that the client application can correctly communicate with the updated backend service and avoid data serialization errors.
Acceptance Criteria:

    Given the API contract for OverrideValueRequest has changed (e.g., the Value field is now a string instead of an Int32),
    When the client prepares to send the request,
    Then the client-side data model for the request must match the new structure, and the data must be correctly formatted (e.g., the integer value is converted to a string).

    Given the API contract for OverrideValueResponse has changed (e.g., Success is renamed to IsValid and Error is now ErrorMessage),
    When the client receives and deserializes the response,
    Then the client-side data model for the response must match the new structure.

    Given the response model has been updated,
    When the client-side logic processes the response,
    Then it must correctly read the new fields (IsValid, ErrorMessage) to determine the outcome of the request.

    Given all necessary code changes have been implemented,
    When the user toggles the "Override" feature,
    Then the end-to-end functionality must work correctly with the new API contract, successfully handling both valid and invalid responses without crashing.

Notes for Implementation:

    Update the client-side Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or model classes that represent the OverrideValueRequest and OverrideValueResponse.

    Adjust any logic responsible for serializing the request and deserializing the response.

    This is a high-risk change for breaking functionality. Thorough testing is required to verify that the communication with the endpoint is successful and that the application behaves as expected for both success and failure cases.


**********************************************************************
1. Eliminate the Redundant Outer Copy
Your initial if statement checks if (result.MacAddress.Length == 4). Because you've guaranteed the length is exactly 4, calculating shortenedRes.Length - 4 results in 0. This means your Array.Copy is simply creating an exact, 1:1 duplicate of result.MacAddress. You can skip this copy entirely and just use the original array.

2. Remove Inside-Loop Allocations (GC Pressure)
Inside the foreach loop, the code currently allocates two brand-new arrays on every single iteration:

Array.ConvertAll(...) creates a new byte[].

new byte[4] creates another new byte[].

For an application that might check interfaces frequently, this creates unnecessary garbage collection (GC) pressure. Since you are only checking 4 bytes, comparing them directly by index is vastly faster and requires zero allocations.

3. Simplify with LINQ
The foreach loop with an if (!condition) continue; match = x; break; is the exact structural pattern that LINQ's .FirstOrDefault() was designed to replace.

Refactored Zero-Allocation Solution
Here is a highly optimized version that achieves the exact same result without allocating any new arrays:

*******************************************************************
var targetMac = result.MacAddress;
var interfaces = target.GetBluetoothInterfaces();

IBluetoothInterface? bluetoothInterface;

if (targetMac.Length == 4)
{
    // Evaluates directly against the source arrays, generating zero GC pressure
    bluetoothInterface = interfaces.FirstOrDefault(i =>
    {
        var val = i.BdAddress?.Address?.Val;
        
        if (val == null || val.Length < 4) return false;

        int len = val.Length;
        return (val[len - 4] ?? 0) == targetMac[0] &&
               (val[len - 3] ?? 0) == targetMac[1] &&
               (val[len - 2] ?? 0) == targetMac[2] &&
               (val[len - 1] ?? 0) == targetMac[3];
    });
}
else
{
    // WARNING: See note below regarding reference vs. value equality
    bluetoothInterface = interfaces.FirstOrDefault(ti => ti.BdAddress?.Address == targetMac);
}
